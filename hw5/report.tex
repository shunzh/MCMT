\section*{Exercise 5.1}

From Exercise 3.1, we know that $\pi$ is fully supported, i.e., $\pi(x) > 0$
for all $x$.

To show that $\delta_x P^t$ is not fully supported for any $t \geq 0$ by
induction.

Base case: $\delta_x$ has only support of 1. So $\delta_x P^0 = \delta_x$ is not
fully supported.

Inductive step: assume that for some $t \geq 0$, $\delta_x P^t$ is not fully
supported. Want to show that $\delta_x P^{t+1}$ is not fully supported either.
Consider state $y$ such that
