\section*{Exercise 8.1}

For any non-negative constant $c$, define $\{\tau \leq t\} = 1_{|(X_0, \cdots,
X_t)| = c}$.  Then $\tau = c$ is a stopping time.

Suppose there are two stopping times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$.
We can make $\{X_0, \cdots, X_s\}$ satisfy $\{\tau_1 \leq s\}$ and $\{X_{s},
\cdots, X_t\}$ satisfy $\{\tau_2 \leq t - s\}$.
That is, $\{\tau_1 + \tau_2 \leq t\} = \{\tau_1 \leq s\} \land \{\tau_2 \leq t -
s, X_0 = y\}$, where $y$ is the state when $\{\tau_1 \leq s\}$ is true.
So $\tau_1 + \tau_2$ is a stopping time.

\section*{Exercise 8.2}

Consider a Markov chain of three states. $x_1$ represents one complete graph
except the shared vertex. $x_2$ represents the other complete graph except the
shared vertex. $x_3$ is the shared vertex. Then $P(x_1, x_3) = \dfrac{1}{2n-1}$.

Start with $\delta_1$ (which means starting with arbitrary distribution that
only covers the first complete graph except the shared vertex in the original
graph).

$\P(X_t = x_1) \geq (1 - \dfrac{1}{2n-1})^t \geq 1 - \dfrac{t}{2n-1}$.
As $\pi(x_1) < \dfrac{1}{2}$, we want $\P(X_t = x_1) < \dfrac{1}{2} +
\dfrac{1}{4}$ for $t = t_{mix}$.

So $1 - \dfrac{t}{2n-1} < \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} = \dfrac{3}{4}$,
$\dfrac{t}{2n-1} > \dfrac{1}{4}$,
$t > \dfrac{n}{2}$.

That is, $t_{mix} > \dfrac{2}{n}$.
