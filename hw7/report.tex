\section*{Exercise 7.1}

For any state $x$, 
$\sum_{y \in \Omega} \hat{P}(x, y)
= \dfrac{\sum_{y \in \Omega} \pi(y) P(y, x)}{\pi(x)}
= \dfrac{\pi(x)}{\pi(x)}
= 1
$.
We know $\pi, P$ are all non-negative. Multiplicaiton is closed for non-negative
numbers, so $\hat{P}$ is non-negative.

So $\hat{P}$ is a stochastic matrix.

\section*{Exercise 7.2}

Show $\hat{P}^n (n, \cdot) = \pi$ by induction on the number of states in the
Markov Chain, which is $n+1$ (from 0 to n).

Base case: when $n = 0$, the Markov Chain has 1 state. $\hat{P}^0 (0, \cdot) =
\delta_0$. This is the stationary distribution.

Inductive step: assume that $\hat{P}^n (n, \cdot) = \pi$ for some $n \geq 0$.
Consider a transition matrix $Q$ on a Markov chain with $n+2$ states.
$Q^n(n+1, \cdot) = \pi'$ by induction hypothesis, where $\pi'$ is the stationary
distribution for the Markov chain of the states $1, 2, \cdots, n+1$.

Consider $Q^{n+1}(n+1, \cdot)$, which is $Q^{n}(n+1, \cdot) Q$.

$Q^{n+1}(n+1, 0) = Q^{n}(n+1, 1) Q(1, 0) = \dfrac{1}{2} 1 = \dfrac{1}{2}$.

$Q^{n+1}(n+1, 1) = Q^{n}(n+1, 2) Q(2, 1) = \dfrac{1}{2^2} 1 = \dfrac{1}{2^2}$.

$\cdots$

$Q^{n+1}(n+1, n) = Q^{n}(n+1, n+1) Q(n+1, n) = \dfrac{1}{2^{n+1}} 1 =
\dfrac{1}{2^{n+1}}$.

$Q^{n+1}(n+1, n+1) = Q^{n}(n+1, n+1) Q(n+1, n+1) = \dfrac{1}{2^{n+1}} 1 =
\dfrac{1}{2^{n+1}}$.

This is the stationary distribution for the Markov chain with $n+2$ states.
